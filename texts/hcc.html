				<h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>
				<p>
					For many patients (e.g., those covered by Medicare), their health insurance provider is reimbursed some money by the government based on how sick the patient is. The provider is responsible for tracking and reporting this information, but the government has strict requirements for what medical documentation is needed to submit an illness for reimbursement.
				</p>
				<p>
					Failing to submit all of the relevant illnesses, or have the right evidence to back them up, can mean millions of lost revenue. So providers employ special staff to review the documentation to ensure nothing was missed, either by the provider when submitting, or even by the doctors when writing their clinical notes. This extra layer of security is expensive, but worthwhile if it can be made extremely efficient.
