				<h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>
				<p>
					For many patients (e.g., those covered by Medicare), their health insurance provider is reimbursed some money by the government based on how sick the patient is. The provider is responsible for tracking and reporting this information, but the government has strict requirements for what medical documentation is needed to submit an illness for reimbursement.
				</p>
				<p>
					Failing to submit all of the relevant illnesses, or have the right evidence to back them up, can mean millions of lost revenue. So providers employ special staff to review the documentation to ensure nothing was missed, either by the provider when submitting, or even by the doctors when writing their clinical notes. This extra layer of security is expensive, but worthwhile if it can be made extremely efficient.
				</p>

				<h2>THE SOLUTION</h2>

				<p>
					<strong>HCC Scout</strong> uses natural language processing and complex algorithms to analyze the various illnesses and injuries mentioned in a patient's clinical notes. When a missed opportunity for reimbursement is discovered, the relevant documents are sent to an expert team for confirmation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Users instantly see exactly what was discovered alongside potential evidence, allowing them to perform their reviews quickly and efficiently. Managers can use the administrative dashboard to track performance, manage their team, and prioritize incoming opportunities.

				<h2>THE PROCESS</h2>

				<section>
					<p><h3>Research</h3></p>
					<p>
						Finding opportunities for reimbursement involves reading hundreds of documents a day, looking for evidence of illnesses not already submitted to the government. This involves coordination between a wide network of individuals, including doctors, administrative staff, IT, business analysts, and (of course) coding experts.
					</p>
					<p>
						My first task was to map this network. I performed interviews with various stakeholders, and observed coders as they went about their typical day. At the same time, I was able to document the existing process and identify pain points. This step was critically important, because the final product introduced a significantly different (and improved) workflow, but the overall service still needed to fit into the broader context of the organization.

					<p><h3>Analyzing Return on Investment</h3></p>
					<p>
						To gain support (read: funding) for the product, my team first needed to prove its potential. Working with business analysts, we built an extremely rough "Wizard of Oz"-esque prototype using Excel and a small sample of previously-reviewed documents. This tiny A/B test showed signs of potential, and the project was funded.
					</p>
					<p>
						Throughout development, the team released working, alpha versions periodically to continue testing if we were on the right track. These functional prototypes were fantastic for testing usability and getting insightful feedback from users.
					</p>

				<section>
					<p><h3>Usability Testing</h3></p>
					<p>
						Parallel to testing the efficacy of the underlying technology, I also tested a number of design prototypes. I quickly moved to interactive prototypes in order to gauge time on task, number of clicks, and other quantitive measures during real-world scenarios.
