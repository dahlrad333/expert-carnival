				<h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>
				<p>
					Although the amount of tests, batteries, poking, and prodding patients endure is ever increasing, simple text notes still make up 80% of the typical electronic medical record. These notes can be pages long, and take minutes to read through fully. With so little time to spend with each patient, doctors and nurses can only skim a few notes, and hope nothing too important was buried on page 7 of a note three tabs away. Even after finding relevant information, they still need to synthesize that data with the rest of the patient's chart.

				<h2>THE PROCESS</h2>

				<section>
					<h3>Research</h3>
					<p>
						To understand how care givers interact with the electronic medical record, I spent weeks shadowing doctors, interviewing staff, and reviewing copious related literature. Through shadowing doctors as they rounded and met with patients, I was able to observe how notes were created, reviewed, copied, printed, ignored, loved, and hated. Through interviews, I learned about the life of notes outside of the hospital, dove deep into their informational needs, and more. And through extensive reading, I could compare the struggles of UPMC with other hospital systems around the world, and gain insight into past attempts to solve the problem.
