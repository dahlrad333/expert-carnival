<p>
    Hiperos 3PM is a third party manangement service which helps companies
    mitagate risks associated with 3rd and 4th party vendors.
    The service was in transition when I stepped into this team.
    They were moving from an on-premises setup to a cloud architecture.
</p>

<p>
    My contributions to the project included working on bleeding edge
    virtualization techniques for Windows Containers. I made numerous
    contributions to open source projects such as Vagrant and Puppet to
    support my team.
</p>

<p>
    In addition to giving back to the community, I also prototyped many different
    solutions for moving 3PM into the cloud such as using Kubernetes,
    Docker Swarm, and AWS Auto Scale. To keep their production, CI, and local
    builds cohesive, I worked on having vagrant make use of the docker containers.
</p>

<p>
    While this was a short project, I accomplished my goal of taking charge of
    their AWS account and documenting important resources and finding cost
    savings by turning of unneeded resources. Also, the numerous cloud architectures I prototyped helped the business leadership make key decisions about the
    future direction of thier cloud.
