<p>
    Primary Health Network Marketing Department approached me to build a
    mobile app for them to promote their brand and increase awareness.
    We started the project by agreeing on a feature set and a timeline to
    achieve milestones.
</p>

<p>
    I was able to work remotely with their team on getting wireframes and other
    assets for the app throughout development, though occasionally I would
    drop by their office to work on complex aspects such as app store submission
    or when I wanted to get certain features signed off on.
</p>

<p>
    The people of Primary Health Network are a fun bunch to work with,
    and I am sure they will consider using me for future projects.
