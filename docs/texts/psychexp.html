            <h3>Summary</h3>
            Working on a clandestine app which could revolutionize
            payment systems like Apple Pay, Android Pay, Samsung Pay.

            <h3>Methods</h3>
            provisional patent
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Client</h3>
            Personal project

    </ul>

<h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>

<p>
    Unfortunately, the current status of the project precludes
    me from exposing too much about it. What I can say is
    that current payment providers in the mobile space will
    probably be interested in talking with us to discuss licensing.
</p>

<h2>THE GOAL</h2>

<p>
    Make lots of money. Well, actually that is just a side effect.
    I would really enjoy if my project becomes reality as it will
    greatly improve many metrics of POS transactions.
</p>

<h2>THE PROCESS</h2>

<p>
    My team has already secured a provisional patent, and is working on a
    prototype to support a full patent.
    We are also looking to expand our team and spin this idea out into a company.
    Once we have done that, I am sure we will probably be looking for some VC
    funding. Check back for updates.
