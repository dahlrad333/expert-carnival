<h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>

<p>
    Recently, there has been a large push toward developing more STEM workers.
    This has been viewed as a pipeline problem. Stem Jobs is addressing this with
    their website which is aimed at high school students. A core feature of this
    website is a quiz which helps students decide which career paths will be
    interesting to them.

<h2>THE PROCESS</h2>

<p>
    My team and I worked with Victory Media for four months to understand the
    challenges Stem Jobs had faced in their goal.
    Once we had identified the pain points in usability, we were able to take
    action in implementing the solutions.

<h2>THE SOLUTION</h2>
<p>
    One of our immediate observations was regarding the layout of the website was clumsy, and did not keep the attention of students. We spent the summer ideating and refining the overall design and iteratively developing a high fidelity prototype. In the end, the site had a more polished and modern look.
</p>
To support the new design, and address security concerns, we upgraded the
Ember version being used.
</p>
<p>
    Since the results of our design are covered by a non-disclosure agreement, I am unable to reveal any more details for this project.
