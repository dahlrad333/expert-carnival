<h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>

<p>
    Recently, there has been a large push toward developing more STEM workers.
    This has been viewed as a pipeline problem. Stem Jobs is addressing this with
    their website which is aimed at high school students. A core feature of this
    website is a quiz which helps students decide which career paths will be
    interesting to them.

<h2>THE SOLUTION</h2>

<p>
    My team and I worked with Victory Media for four months to understand the
    challenges Stem Jobs had faced in their goal.
    Once we had identified the pain points in usability, we were able to take
    action in implementing the solutions. First, we wanted to upgrade the platform
    to a more recent version, as there were performance issues related to the version
    in production. Also, we noticed the layout of the website was clumsy, and did not keep the attention of students. We addressed this by giving the site a more modern look.

<h2>DIVING IN</h2>

<p>The bulk of the research phase was spent investigating small-group learning inside actual classrooms and children's museums. In total, we visited eighteen classrooms across kindergarten to sixth grade, and three museums. In these environments we conducted <strong>observational studies</strong> of small-group learning in practice, <strong>contextual interviews and artifact walkthroughs</strong> with teachers, and dispersed <strong>self-reporting kits</strong> to track actions outside of our observations. Based on our results, we crafted three <strong>personas</strong> to describe the main players involved in small-group learning, and outlined four guidelines for designing our final solution:</p>

    <li>
        <h3>Educational Ecosystem</h3>
        School systems are just that: systems. There are a number of moving parts that must be accounted for when introducing a new product into the space.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Group Dynamics</h3>
        Small group learning takes place in a variety of contexts, and teachers structure groups in different ways to achieve social and educational goals.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Customized Content</h3>
        Classroom technologies should enable teachers to customize content and help them cater to the needs of each individual student.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Captivating Interactions</h3>
        Today's technologies have the potential to provide students with engaging, exploratory learning experiences in a way that has never been possible.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>THE SOLUTION</h2>

<p>We spent the summer ideating and refining the overall design and iteratively developing a high fidelity prototype. We worked with 3M to provide various design ideas grounded in our research findings and choosing the one that most fit the need. We went through the process of ideation from May through June and followed up with concept validation to narrow down our ideas. We also communicated with research participants, and provided them with <strong>low-fidelity prototypes to get quick feedback</strong>. Once the direction had been set, we iteratively designed and tested <strong>several hardware and software prototypes</strong>.</p>

<p>As part of the iterative design process, the usability-testing phase began in July. We user-tested our product in classrooms to see how it fit into the environment. In the end, we provided 3M with pixel-perfect mockups of the software interface, a Flash demo of the hardware capabilities, a medium-fidelity prototype of the hardware design, and a video showing (with some computer trickery) our solution in action.</p>

<p>Since the results of our design are covered by a non-disclosure agreement, I am unable to reveal any more details for this project.</p>
