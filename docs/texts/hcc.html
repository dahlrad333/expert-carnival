    <h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>
    <p>
        For many patients (e.g., those covered by Medicare), their health insurance provider is reimbursed some money by the government based on how sick the patient is. The provider is responsible for tracking and reporting this information, but the government has strict requirements for what medical documentation is needed to submit an illness for reimbursement.
    </p>
    <p>
        Failing to submit all of the relevant illnesses, or have the right evidence to back them up, can mean millions of lost revenue. So providers employ special staff to review the documentation to ensure nothing was missed, either by the provider when submitting, or even by the doctors when writing their clinical notes. This extra layer of security is expensive, but worthwhile if it can be made extremely efficient.
    </p>

    <h2>THE SOLUTION</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>HCC Scout</strong> uses natural language processing and complex algorithms to analyze the various illnesses and injuries mentioned in a patient's clinical notes. When a missed opportunity for reimbursement is discovered, the relevant documents are sent to an expert team for confirmation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Users instantly see exactly what was discovered alongside potential evidence, allowing them to perform their reviews quickly and efficiently. Managers can use the administrative dashboard to track performance, manage their team, and prioritize incoming opportunities.

    <h2>THE PROCESS</h2>

    <section>
        <p><h3>Research</h3></p>
        <p>
            Finding opportunities for reimbursement involves reading hundreds of documents a day, looking for evidence of illnesses not already submitted to the government. This involves coordination between a wide network of individuals, including doctors, administrative staff, IT, business analysts, and (of course) coding experts.
        </p>
        <p>
            My contributions to the solution were primarily interfacing the
            natural language processing to the RESTful backend. The backend
            would ingest a daily report of new documents that had been
            digitally imaged. These documents would be tested for potential
            missing HL7 codes. The backend would in turn drive the front end for
            the [human] medial coders, highlighting these opportunities.
            In addition, I would also consume wireframes from designers and
            translate them into functional webpages.

        <p><h3>Analyzing Return on Investment</h3></p>
        <p>
            To gain support (read: funding) for the product, my team first needed to prove its potential. Working with business analysts, we built an extremely rough "Wizard of Oz"-esque prototype using Excel and a small sample of previously-reviewed documents. This tiny A/B test showed signs of potential, and the project was funded.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout development, the team released working, alpha versions periodically to continue testing if we were on the right track. These functional prototypes were fantastic for testing usability and getting insightful feedback from users.
