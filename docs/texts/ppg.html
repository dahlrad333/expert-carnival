<h2>TRANSITION FROM COOKIE TO BRAND</h2>

<p>
    Oreo was a well recognized a cookie, however, they wanted to push further to
    become one of the most iconic brands. To do so required big story telling.
    The answer lay in the human value of wonder, a value that everyone, regardless of age, can identify with. This renewed focus has contemporized the brand and sharpened their point-of-view. It has broadened thier appeal, outperforming all expectations, and positioned Oreo for the future.

<h2>CUSTOMIZATION TO THE RESCUE</h2>

<p>
    There is a current trend of customization/personalization in consumer products.
    To cash in on this, Oreo created a interactive website where users could
    design and order their customized Oreo product.
</p>

<h2>THE PROCESS</h2>
<p>
We just helped Oreo launch Colorfilled—a direct-to-consumer platform where Oreo fans in the U.S. can digitally design unique holiday-themed packs of Oreos for friends and family. For the first time, Oreo customers will have custom packages delivered to their doorstep in 5-7 days thanks to this new e-commerce program. This is a key initiative within Mondelēz International’s overall e-commerce strategy, which aims at growing e-commerce revenues to $1 billion by 2020.

<h2>THE SOLUTION</h2>

<p>
    We built a solution that levered technologies like AWS, Shopify, Ember, and uWSGI. We also had immense support from design and creative.
    It was truly a pleasure to be able to work on a team where everyone was an expert in their role.
</p>
<p>
    With such a team, we were able to create the app from scratch in two months,
    ahead of our compressed timeline to deliver for the holiday season.
