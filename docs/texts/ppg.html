<h2>TRANSITION FROM COOKIE TO BRAND</h2>

<p>
    Oreo was a well recognized a cookie, however, they wanted to push further to
    become one of the most iconic brands. To do so required big story telling.
    The answer lay in the human value of wonder, a value that everyone, regardless of age, can identify with. This renewed focus has contemporized the brand and sharpened their point-of-view. It has broadened thier appeal, outperforming all expectations, and positioned Oreo for the future.

<h2>CUSTOMIZATION TO THE RESCUE</h2>

<p>
    There is a current trend of customization/personalization in consumer products.
    To cash in on this, Oreo created a interactive website where users could
    design and order their customized Oreo product.
</p>

<h2>THE PROCESS</h2>
<p>
We just helped Oreo launch Colorfilled—a direct-to-consumer platform where Oreo fans in the U.S. can digitally design unique holiday-themed packs of Oreos for friends and family. For the first time, Oreo customers will have custom packages delivered to their doorstep in 5-7 days thanks to this new e-commerce program. This is a key initiative within Mondelēz International’s overall e-commerce strategy, which aims at growing e-commerce revenues to $1 billion by 2020.

<h2>THE SOLUTION</h2>

<p>
    We built a solution that levered technologies like AWS, Shopify, Ember, and uWSGI. We also had immense support from design and creative.
    It was truly a pleasure to be able to work on a team where everyone was an expert in their role.
</p>
<p>
    With such a team, we were able to create the app from scratch in two months,
    ahead of our compressed timeline to deliver for the holiday season.

<h3>The Burgh:</h3>

<p>Transplants are inherently ignorant of the news, events, and so on in Pittsburgh, and thus would have no knowledge of even where to find those offerings. We realized the unparalleled discoverability of print coupled with the Post-Gazette's competency with distribution would provide the perfect avenue for introducing transplants to our service. Thus was born The Burgh, a weekly print publication designed to foster familiarity with Pittsburgh and highlight the offerings available in its many neighborhoods. Importantly, much of this information was already avaiable in the Post-Gazette, but repackaging it in a different venue would enable a new, broader audience to find it.</p>

<h3>postgazette.com</h3>

<p>Formerly imagined as an independent section in the website, we started from the ground up and devised an entire redesign of postgazette.com. We proposed to have every news article, event listing, and classified advertisement geotagged and placed behind an interactive map interface. Stories would be filterable by a number of categories (e.g., breaking news, sports, movies, etc.), and could always be presented within their geographic context. More than just showing the official boundaries between neighborhoods, the map would highlight the Pittsburgh areas that have grown organically out of citizens' actions. </p>

<p>The website itself would also become organic, allowing readers to track, edit, and submit events happening around the city. As a user-editable hub of everything Pittsburgh, The Post-Gazette would be in a unique position to follow the reader through his or her entire journey, from discovering an event to attending the event to sharing the experience with others. Whether this was as simple as providing bus route information or enabling the reader to upload photographs, postgazette.com would become a new venue through which readers could participate in Pittsburgh. The deep connections postgazette.com could foster pushed our service to its fullest, finally enabling it to cover all stages of the experience cycle.</p>
