    <h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>
    <p>
        Google acquired Channel Intelligence to bolster its e-commerce offerings.
        Specifically, it needed a way to take a variety of data streams from partners and
        optimally place ads not only on Google Shopping but on a variety of channels
        such as Nexttag, PriceGrabber, Shopzilla, and Shopping.com.

    <h2>THE SOLUTION</h2>
    <p>
        Channel Intelligence (CI) does what it says on the tin, creating a pipeline designed to create uniformity
        across data sources and can automatically bid directly to all the channels.
    </p>
    <p>
        It also detects errors in the stream and will prevent the bad data from making it
        further down the stream. This avoids having accounts flagged, ineffective ad spend, or
        incorrect prices/products from going live.

    <h2>THE PROCESS</h2>

    <section>
        <p><h3>Research</h3></p>
        <p>
            The team spent weeks learning both the Google and CI tech stack, as we prepared to migrate
            over 120 top retailers including, Reebok, Victoria Secret, Office Depot, and Bose.
            Once we had learned the differences, we were prepared to execute the migration of logic and data.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <p><h3>Prototyping & Testing</h3></p>
        <p>
            We developed an internal tool to determine the readiness of retailers' feeds. This allowed us to quickly
            identify where problems would occur if the legacy feed was ingested by CI.
            Based on these findings, we would schedule calls with account managers as needed to advise them
            of the remedies they would have to implement on their end.
        </p>
        <p>
            The data quality ranged in fidelity, with some retailers ready to go on Day 1, while others had much work to do.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eventually all the feeds were made good, and we were ready to migrate onto the Google version of CI.

    </ul>
    <br/>

    <section>
        <p><h3>Refinement</h3></p>
        <p>
            Even after retailers corrected the issues that were raised, sometimes some items would still get flagged.
            This could be for various reasons, such as a automation even further upstream, or poor inventory tracking. For small issues like this
            we would direct the retailer to file support tickets to be handled by lower tier support.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, if a large percentage of items were experiencing issues, our team was ready to assist
            the retailer through our point of contact. Luckily, we were able to get most of the feeds mostly working on the first go, so
            this case was rather rare.
