            <h3>Summary</h3>
            Most of the average patient's medical record is simple, narrative text. This tool leveraged natural language processing to help care providers find the most important information faster.

    <h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>
    <p>
        Although the amount of tests, batteries, poking, and prodding patients endure is ever increasing, simple text notes still make up 80% of the typical electronic medical record. These notes can be pages long, and take minutes to read through fully. With so little time to spend with each patient, doctors and nurses can only skim a few notes, and hope nothing too important was buried on page 7 of a note three tabs away. Even after finding relevant information, they still need to synthesize that data with the rest of the patient's chart.

    <h2>THE SOLUTION</h2>
    <p>
        The <strong>Intelligent Document Navigator</strong> (IDN) does what it says on the tin, assisting doctors as they navigate the plethora of clinical documents in a patient's medical record. With the tool, doctors can view related documents, see automatic document summaries, analyze health measurements across documents over time, highlight important documents for other doctors, filter by specialty, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
        The IDN leverages natural language processing to pinpoint important phrases throughout the documents. Special algorithms pull together this data and more to uncover hidden relationships between documents, and personalize the experience to how the current user normally navigates.

    <h2>THE PROCESS</h2>

    <section>
        <p><h3>Research</h3></p>
        <p>
            To understand how care givers interact with the electronic medical record, I spent weeks shadowing doctors, interviewing staff, and reviewing copious related literature. Through shadowing doctors as they rounded and met with patients, I was able to observe how notes were created, reviewed, copied, printed, ignored, loved, and hated. Through interviews, I learned about the life of notes outside of the hospital, dove deep into their informational needs, and more. And through extensive reading, I could compare the struggles of UPMC with other hospital systems around the world, and gain insight into past attempts to solve the problem.

        <p><h3>Prototyping & Testing</h3></p>
        <p>
            Based on the research findings, I experimented with various solutions designed to improve three main areas: <strong>discovery</strong>, <strong>comprehension</strong>, and <strong>speed</strong>. Through prototyping and usability testing, I was able to learn which interactions made sense to doctors, and what data they found most important.
        </p>
        <p>
            The prototypes ranged in fidelity, including simple storyboards sketched on paper, click-through prototypes in Keynote, and interactive HTML/JavaScript prototypes. Each prototype was tested with doctors during on-site usability testing sessions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The HTML prototypes were eventually replaced with live, pre-release versions of the product. I worked directly in the codebase, implementing tweaks and experimental features derived from user feedback.

        <p><h3>Refinement</h3></p>
        <p>
            The first prototypes used dummy data, and focused on the <em>kinds</em> of interactions and data the doctor would be experiencing. This allowed me to get quick and meaningful feedback on the proposed concepts without users getting bogged down in specifics.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, testing tailor-made scenarios only gets you so far. As the iterations become more refined, I pulled sample data from de-identified patient charts to test exactly what information needed to be exposed to doctors. Seeing how the design performed with various datasets exposed the feasibility of each feature, and highlighted new avenues to explore in future releases.
