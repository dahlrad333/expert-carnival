            Currently working on a Android app to replace the one

<h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>

<p>
    From time to time, I enjoy playing poker. One of the formats in which
    poker can be played is tournament style. In this style,
    there is a blind schedule which is to be followed. This requires
    some sort of timing device. While in theory a regular clock would be
    sufficient, we desire a more full featured tool specifically designed.
</p>

<h2>THE GOAL</h2>

<p>
    To be more functional than any of the current free apps available in the
    Play store. This will allow my play group to have a better experience
    while we are playing.
</p>

<h2>THE PROCESS</h2>

<p>
    To accomplish this, I am using a framework
    to help build the UI for Android quickly.
    A very very very very very rough proof-of-concept, is currently
    on my GitHub if you are clever and know how to find it.
    To be honest, I really have not spent much time on it.
    I usually say I am going to have it ready next week, and then
    I get busy with other stuff and it does not happen. Maybe this week.
