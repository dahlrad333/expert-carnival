<h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>

<p>
    With the myriad of cloud based tools growing each day,
    trying to more than a few at the same time could be distracting.
    This can result in lost productivity from the hours of searching and
    switching tabs that can result.
 </p>

<h2>THE GOAL</h2>

<p>
    When I was brought into this project, there were two other external vendors
    which had created the front and back ends. It was my job to reconcile these
    solutions, guide the team, and create new plugins to connect additional
    serivices to our platform.

<h2>THE PROCESS</h2>

<p>
    With less than three months of funding, our team worked quickly to acomplish our goals. Along our path, I conducted code reviews, provided reports to C-level
    people, and created a CI/CD pipeline.
</p>

<p>
    Unfortunately, with no customers, and a short runway, the company ran out of
    money, and was unable to secure A round funding to keep the project going.
    It is a cool idea, and I just think circumstances prevented the company from
    really taking off.
