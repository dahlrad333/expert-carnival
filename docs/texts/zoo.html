<h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>

<p>
    With the myriad of cloud based tools growing each day,
    trying to more than a few at the same time could be distracting.
    This can result in lost productivity from the hours of searching and
    switching tabs that can result.
 </p>

<h2>THE GOAL</h2>

<p>
    When I was brought into this project, there were two other external vendors
    which had created the front and back ends. It was my job to reconcile these
    solutions, guide the team, and create new plugins to connect additional
    serivices to our platform.

<h2>THE PROCESS</h2>

<p>
    With less than three months of funding, our team worked quickly to acomplish our goals.
</p>

<p>
    My team also <strong>spent time observing the space</strong> within which the exhibit would exist in order to get a sense of the physical limitations when designing an interface which would (if all went well) provide a large attraction. Between our observations and interviews, we had a flood of data to manage. To help organize our thoughts and gain a complete understanding, we synthesized our findings into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_design">cultural, artifact, physical, and flow models</a>.
</p>

<p>After a short immersion in the problem space, we spent the rest of our weeks designing and testing the interface. We started by investigating arcade games and similar exhibits at other zoos and museums. We <strong>paper prototyped a handful of ideas</strong> before settling on the idea of framing the exhibit as a competitive game. Players would have 90 seconds to capture as many photos as they could, after which they would review the photos to identify the fish within. However, from previous observations, we realized the game would also need a "free swim" mode. The fast-paced competition would be suitable for when many children crowded the exhibit, but during quiet times (like midweek at 10am) having to stop every 90 seconds could be frustrating for a child. </p>

<p>In addition to user testing with <strong>think-alouds</strong>, we also performed <strong>heuristic evaluations</strong> and used <a href="http://cogtool.hcii.cs.cmu.edu/">CogTool</a> to test our interface. These methods provided strong evidence to <strong>guide and support our design decisions</strong>. </p>
