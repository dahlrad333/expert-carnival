<p>
    Care Orchestrator is a sleep and respiratory care management system.
    The number of people living with chronic sleep apnea and respiratory disease continues to grow. And so do the challenges of caring for them. Care Orchestrator is our breakthrough cloud-based application that connects homecare providers, physicians, and payers with patients – across the entire health continuum. It gives you the power and flexibility to remotely monitor and manage all of your sleep and respiratory patients.

<h2>THE GOAL</h2>

<p>
    My role on Care Orchestrator was to lead the UI team to develop reusable
    components for building the product.

<p>
    This is a really cool project that I really enjoyed working on. Unfortunately non-disclosure agreements forbid me from commenting
    further about my impact at Philips.
