<h2>PROBLEM</h2>

<p>
    As an aging bank, PNC houses data on many different mainframes [yes, those
    still exist]. As each person is unique, in the same way accounts in these
    mainframes are also very unique resulting in odd combinations of data to
    display when the customer logs in. This is fine for the average Joe,
    but for their premier customers PNC would like to offer a more unified
    and polished look and feel.

<h2>DATA AT OUR FINGERTIPS</h2>
<p>
    First, we started by defining which users would be offered this service.
    This strata was defined by a combination of data sources that were available
    to the website. Once we identified this strata, we started modifying a few
    pages. During my time there, I contributed to about three full pages of
    changes.
