<h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>

<p>
    Tracking animals used for medical research is a tedious and time-consuming
    process. Current regulations require daily health checks on the animals,
    which must be properly identified with a cage card. The state of the
    art leaves much to be desired and we have decided to take up the task.
</p>
<p>
    At the core, we have an RFID tag mounted on the ear of each animal.
    This allows us to identify animals without removing them from their
    cage. The app then keeps track of various data in a cloud database,
    and automates some of the manual tasks resulting in cost savings.
</p>
<p>
    On the billing side of things,
    researchers pay for space and administration of the cages that they are using. This billing process also is quite involved. With powerful RFID room readers
    we are able to greatly reduce the work for the biller to produce invoices,
    and also gives more transparency into the costs of housing these animals.
</p>
<p>
    This project is on-going, and I am excited to see a startup which will
    be commercially viable without huge VC input. I will update this page
    with any interesting developments.

<h2>THE GOAL</h2>

<p>
    To reduce costs associated with laboratory animals.
